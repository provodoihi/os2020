# Practical Work 2: Pipe and I/O Redirection
- List all files in current directory containing «list» in their names (filter with grep).
    + Command: `ls Desktop| grep "list"`. In this case, I change the directory to *Desktop*
    + Output: 
        >list123 
- Count how many lines that /etc/passwd has (use wc)
    + Command: `wc -l /etc/passwd`
    + Output:
        > 41 /etc/passwd
- Check how much memory that your machine has, not free memory (use free)
    + Command: `free | awk '{print $1,$2}'|head -2`. Using `head` to avoid printing swap line
    + Output:
        >total used   
        Mem: 2005948
- Find how many logical core that your CPU has (see/proc/cpuinfo)
    + Command: `grep "cpu cores" /proc/cpuinfo`. In this case, I installed my GNU/Linux in a virtual
    machine, so I decided to set the virtual CPU to be dual cores.
    + Output:
        >cpu cores       : 2
- Count how many .jpg files that you have in your photo directory (use find)
    + Command: `find . /home -name "*.jpg"|wc -l`. Since I do not have any picture, so the output is 0.
